# Getting Started

## Welcome to the Lab Guide

This guide is a supplement to the Delphix Admin Training courses,
and provides several exercises to perform throughout the class. If you
encounter any issues during the exercises, please do not hesitate to ask your
instructor for advice.

## Lab Requirements

In order to perform these lab exercises, you will need:

  * A modern HTML5 capable web browser (IE10+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## The Delphix Admin Training Cloud Lab

Your instructor should have provided you with a **Class Name** and a **Student
Number**. In order access your lab server, point your web browser to: http://
**classname**.agile.today/ **studentnumber**  
For example, if your **Class Name** is  "acmetech" and your **Student Number**
is 5, you would go to the site: <http://acmetech.agile.today/5>

The Delphix Labs Login Dialog  

At the login screen, enter the username and password: delphix/delphix

contains everything you will need to perform your lab exercises including:

  * Terminal with RDP to connect to Windows Source and Target servers.

  * Firefox Web Browser to connect to your Delphix Engine

  * Chrome Web Browser

  * Notepad for class notes

  * Lab Guides folder on the Desktop containing any exercises for this course, including this guide.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Do not use the  "Log Out" function on your lab server. If
