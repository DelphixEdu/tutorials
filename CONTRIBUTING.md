# Contributing to LabAlchemy Guides

Thank you for your interest in the LabAlchemy lab guides! We appreciate your feedback, edits, and additions to our docs.

This page covers the basic steps for contributing to our LabAlchemy lab guides.


## Editing topics on the public repo

We've tried to make editing an existing file as simple as possible.
- If you're already in the repo, just navigate to the file and click the **Edit** button.  
- Alternatively, you can fork the repo and make your edits locally

 When you're done, submit a pull request back to the MASTER branch. After you create the pull request, a member of the LabAlchemy team will review your changes.

You can learn the basics of Markdown in just a few minutes.  To get started, check out [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Making more substantial changes

To make substantial changes to an existing exercise, add or change images, or contribute a new exercise, you will need to create a local clone of our content repo.

## Using issues to provide feedback on lab guides

If you just want to provide feedback rather than directly modifying actual documentation pages, you can [create an issue in the public repo](https://github.com/DelphixEdu/lab-guides/issues). Click the "Issues" tab and then click the **New issue** button. Be sure to include the topic title and the URL for the page.

Members of the LabAlchemy team review issues regularly and will triage, assign, and address them accordingly.
